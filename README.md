* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted help to develop their game ‘Win It or Lose It’ into a web-based game. Their requirements were that teams needed to be involved in the game, one or more. They had to have multiple players on each team. The names of the teams and their users had to be unique and ensure nobody else had those names. Also that there had to be a single instance of the game in memory. The latter required checking for this and having unique identifiers.

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel I did the recommendation section particularly well within this documentation. The entire document led to this set of recommendations. It required the research necessary and developing the previous sections in order to put out a set of recommendations that was understandable and applicable to the client.

* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found that seeing the UML was very helpful in creating the design document. This is because it allowed me to see the different areas and code that was necessary for developing the code in the direction needed. It also let me visually take in the client’s requirements and what would be required for developing the web version of the game.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would most likely pick the System Architecture view. This is because I viewed it from my training in IT and how the system was set up and less in the manner in which most people would expect it from a software developer. I would improve it by actually explaining the system architecture of the computers and how they integrate with a web-browser over focusing on how it’s built more from the IT standpoint.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I had to look at how the user would interact with the game. Since the game was through a web-browser, I had to take in the different types of browsers and their requirements when looking at the software design. I also had to look at it through the client’s view because they would have the main architecture, on the server-side of things, for supporting the game as well. This meant that I had to look at the system as a whole for ensuring as little downtime and expansion for holding the user data, for the library of images, and development of the game. This was all to ensure the user’s experience and it’s important because user experience means more people playing the game and more people recommending it.

* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I will say that, due to a lot of this feeling similar and matching some of my actual training from an IT standpoint, I put a lot of my approach from that into my view of designing the software. While I have learned a lot about the software side of things that expands upon that, I would still use that strategy for the base start. Knowing how the systems work from the less programming related side of IT, I am able to take that to start from when designing a program through a base set of requirements. To give an example, there needs to be unique identifies for the users and teams. This means, from an IT standpoint, I need to ensure that on the server side, there needs to be enough storage and memory for that data and in building a network design for a company.
